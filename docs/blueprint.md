- Primary color: Use a muted yellow-green (#9ACD32) to reflect the natural freshness of tropical crops. 
- Background color: A light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0) will provide a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Use a complementary light orange (#FFB347) for calls to action and highlights.
